# ducky-payloads

Hi everyone, i hope you can find this repo a bit useful for you

Here you will find some rubber ducky payload script already compiled and commented divided in 2 main categories:
- Users: here you will find payloads that can be run without requiring elevated privileges
- Administrators: here you will find more invasive payloads that will require adming rights to be executed properly

Under these directories you can find some other sub-directories to categorize the scripts you're looking for.
