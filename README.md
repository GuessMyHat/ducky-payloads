# ducky-payloads

Hi everyone, i hope you can find this repo a bit useful for you

Here you will find some rubber ducky payload script already compiled and commented divided in 2 main categories:
- Users: here you will find payloads that can be run without requiring elevated privileges
- Administrators: here you will find more invasive payloads that will require adming rights to be executed properly

Under these directories you can find some other sub-directories used to categorize the scripts you're looking for.

Notice that some payload samples could be used both as normal users and as administrator users depending on the scripts you're going to run

If you just take the peace of code you need to perform your attack under the /Users/ directory you won't need to elevate your privileges to execute them: same things for the example scripts you can find there <br>
Otherwise, if you look for the same category scripts inside the /Administrators/ directory (even if it already exists in the /Users/ directory) you will need to elevate the privileges of the target machine

So basically, you can turn a normal /Users/ script into an /Administrators/ script, unlike you can't do the same thing with the /Administrators/ scripts to turn them into normal /Users/ scripts
